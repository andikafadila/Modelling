# Regression Analysis and Model Evaluation on Business Dataset
This project focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of a business dataset using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling. The goal is to build predictive models to understand the influence of key variables and provide accurate forecasts.

Project Workflow:
- Data Cleaning: Processed the raw dataset to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized and analyzed the relationships between various features to uncover trends and insights.
- Regression Analysis: Applied two regression algorithms:
- Linear Regression: A simple yet powerful approach to model relationships between variables.
- Decision Tree Regression: A non-linear algorithm that captures complex interactions between features.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of both models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination) to compare their accuracy and predictive capabilities.
- Variable Importance: Identified the most influential variables impacting the target outcome.
- Prediction: Used the models to predict future outcomes, demonstrating their real-world applicability.
Key Features:
- Multiple Regression Models: Comparative analysis between Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression.
- Performance Metrics: Detailed evaluation of each model's strengths and weaknesses.
- Data Insights: Visualizations and statistical analysis to provide a deep understanding of the dataset.

Results:
Discovered key predictors that significantly influence the target variable.
Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
